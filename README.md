# calculator_in_cpp - BODMAS (except B - brackets)

This calculator can take upto 100 operators and 101 operants.
It gives the output based on the order modulo,division,multiplication,addition,subtraction(precedence order)
But this code cannot take paranthesis as input
I would like to improve this code by making the operators and operants unlimited 
And also I wanted to include paranthesis and other functions.
But currently I dont have time for that
