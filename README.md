# calculator_in_cpp - BODMAS (except B - brackets)
```
this calculator can take upto 100 operators and 101 operants it gives the output based on the order modulo,division,multiplication,addition,subtraction(precedence order)
but this code cannot take paranthesis as input
i would like to improve this code by making the operators and operants unlimited and also i wanted to include paranthesis and other functions.
but currently i dont have time for that
